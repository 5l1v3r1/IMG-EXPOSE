I must say i am very Glad to have seen these words you have write to me and it really shows how devoted you are to the relationship.

Dear i am also very romantic and love to kiss too,i have a fragile heart,i really gets emotional that i cry sometime when i feel so alone without a woman by my side to call my own, it makes me feel so empty and that is why since you came into my life i just cant hide but to say how itruely feel about you and dear you dont have to be afraid casue i just can't hide it.

Well dear my daughter is such a free and generouse loving girl and she has alway wanted me to have a woman in my life cause she also needs the care of a mother around her and since i lost my wife please honey i want you to love my daughter and treat her right.

I really loved spending my free time with my family and going to the movie and also to the beach with my family, i love cooking as well i sometime cook for the family when i am free,i really love make a foreplay too and dont know if you mind cause i like putting my tongue there, dear i dont really want to say much but know that we are just a perfect match from what i have seen about you.

Dear i dont have much expectation all what i ask for is your heart, sincerity, open minded, honesty, self respect, and most of all true love theses are all i am asking for ,with theses i think there is a perfect mamily. to me you are like someone i have been with for than past 10 years that is why i am being the way i am now and you should know that i am a very flexible man with an open mind i dont nurse things in my mind, i dont keep secret from the one i call my love, Honey this is just me.

This is the little i have and i know when we meet and have come together as a family you will see it that words are real.

Thanks 

Starting a new life together
 
Its good to get an upfront and sincere response from you. We need time to talk to each other and get to know much more about each other, There are lot of things we need to know about each other and I'm not a kind of man that rush into relationship or marriage. It takes time, time will tell and we have to wait for the lord timing,We have to be so sure and certain of ourselves about making sure that this relationship is what we want out in life, We have to be sure and certain of ourselves that this relationship is our future and everything. We don't just jump or rush into things anyhow. Everything in  life happen for a reason, my being lonely for a very long time makes me want a companion and a woman to  share my feelings with, I'm in search of a soul mate to spend the rest of our lives together. No one is perfect and we could only give it a trial. Though it is right for us to learn from our mistakes. Which makes you resisting and having hard time trusting a man again in your life. A Relationship is all about TRUST, SINCERITY and HONESTY, all this paramount fact must exist in a relationship before anything can work out  of it. I'm a man of my word and will always stand by my word. I'm a caring and loving man, Open minded and Upfront in every aspect of a relationship.Being scared wouldn't solve it. Your being scared will definitely overcome you because you are being unfaithful and not being Trustworthy in the lord. Faith is  the substance of things not seen, but the evidence of things being hoped for, why not put your Faith and Trust in the Lord.

Acquainted to you

I just see myself keep searching for your email and believe me i am getting so acquainted to you . Ever since we started sending the recent messages we've sent to each other...I've been so much thinking about you and to be sincere i am thinking about  you.Wow! So here I stand, among the digital masses. We're not so different after all. Here I stand,surrounded by people who've met on-line,  People who've loved and lost, and people who are found, and somehow, in a desperate world, found each other. So what do I say that hasn't already been written, or been already  said? Hmmm, pretty tough! Okay... try this: I no longer need to hope for love by going to  clubs, (y'know I can't dance!) supermarkets, church socials,by passing notes in class as a kid, or instant messages as an adult. I don't have to search for love, in ads, on theinternet, in chat rooms, text messages, camera phones, faxes, and e-mails. I don't have to wait for good and bad feedback, have to need a good laugh, wait to talk, be told to shut up, look for hope, pray for a miracle, wait for an angel, see hope for God's love here on earth, wish for a special friend, crave for love's passion, envy other's romance or wonder if someone will ever love me. Thanks for coming into my life.

Hugs and Kisses,

Sweet Moses.

That woman is you!

Since i first viewed your profile, i felt a great impulsion on me and ever since then i have been thinking about you , i thought you might be anend to my search or to say a realization of my dreams because you are just what i am looking for and you know when i keep reading from you , i feel that is coming to be true and i pray and hope it does. I will go on the site and delete my profile because this is what i have beenwaiting for the past 5yrs and i would not trade this for the whole world , so i want to see where  this goes and being a one man woman , i will give this a total chance and i am sure it will take me to where i want. I will want you to do the same and delete your profile on the site to see where we go from here so we can concentrate on each other and see what we have for each other. When I was a little boy,I dreamt of that one person that I would share my dreams, happiness and energy with ... I could not see her face but she was there.I always felt like she was out there, I just needed to feel her. I visualized the bond we would have and the courage she would give me to endure life's obstacles. All this years I was with others, and feeling my way through life, learning lessons that later on would prepare me to become the person that I am now. I have felt alone and sad. Then one day my eyes opened and I became that little boy again ... realizing that she is here now. Here in my world was the woman that I had dreamt of and I'd hoped would not miss our meeting in life ... that woman is you!

Crazy about you ...
 
There is so much I want to tell you, a lot has been running through my head lately. I'm having trouble putting my thoughts into words so you will have to bare with me through this.I keep thinking about the future, about life, and what I want out of it. I keep thinking about us and what this relationship means to me.I keep thinking about these things and I realize they go hand in hand. This relationship is my future; it's what I want out of life. I want to grow old with you. I want to experience this crazy love forever and ever,and I really think I'm going to get to. I want us to walk through new houses picking the one that would be just right for us. I want to see you walk around our house in a big t-shirt with your hair down and catch me staring at how gorgeous you are. I want you to pull the covers off me at night and then I have to get evencloser, if it's possible, to you to keep warm. I want to see you laugh like crazy at me when I do stupid stuff. I want to rub lotion all over yourbody because you laid out in the sun  too long. I want to hold you when you cry and smile with you when you smile. I want to fall asleep everynight with you in my arms. I want you to fall asleep on my chest listening to the beat of my heart and know it beats for you I want you to be the first thing I see when I wake up and the last thing I see when I go to sleep.. I want to see your bad morning hair; I think it will be so cute. I want to sit on the beach with you and watch the sun set, and I want all the people who pass us to envy the love that we obviously have for each other.I want to see you walk down that isle and I want to take your hand for the rest of my life. I want to spend all night,and maybe thenext day, making love to you with an undying passion (sorry to be so blunt). I want to sit there talking to you for hours about nothing at all but in the same time everything or maybe we won't talk at all and just grin at each other realizing how lucky we are. I want you to get mad at me for doing something stupid, and I want you to bust out laughing when you try to yell at me. I want to lay with you in front of a fireplace and keep the heat going long after the fire goes out. I want to take trips with you to places we've never been and experience them together. I want us to go skinny-dipping in a hotel pool and get caught and streak back to our hotel room waking everyone up because we're laughing so hard. I want us to go and pick out the hot tub we want with the biggest grins on our faces the whole time.I want our friends to come over and gettotally jealous because they don't share a love like we do. I want to be walking into a store with you and trip and fall on my face and turnaround to see you rolling on the ground laughing at me. I want us to run outside in the rain and act like total kids getting completely soaked, and when we come back in stripping down to nothing as we stumble into the bedroom, or the kitchen counter, or the balcony, or the diningroom table, or an office desk, or the shower, which ever one we feel like at the time.I want it to take your breath away every time I say, "I love you" because you know it's coming from the heart.I want us to sit down with a box of strawberries, a bottle of chocolate syrup, and athing ofmint chocolate ice cream; well, I'll let your imagination finish that one. I want to love you and be with you for at least forever if not a little longer. I couldn't really express in words what I'm feeling right now so I decided to share with you SOME of the images and thoughts that have been running through my head.I just want you to know that I had never found someone I wanted to spend the rest of my life with until I met you. I really am crazy about you, everything about you!

Love and friendship
 
Love and friendship is what I feel with you, it is not just that we are lovers, we are also friends, and that is what makes our relationship much better. Yes I am for real .The greatest of lovers don't make the best of friends, remember that, and when there comes a time when you feel that things can't get any worse, think of me, for I can try my best to bring you all the happiness in the world. I want to grow to love you more and more everyday, and I do not know right now what I would do without you.. Sometimes I would like to think my love for you is like a great dream, I don't want to wake up because I don't want to lose that love. I will be by your side whenever you need me and I hope I am and always will be in your heart and in your dreams forever!

I am so afraid to love again. I am scared my little heart might get broken again. You promise me that you would never hurt me. But, I am just so afraid to love again.

When, my heart got broken for the last time, I was just so afraid to cry because it was the wish of God., I want a life time with you, and for the last time. I am not going to be afraid to love again. I believe in my heart that you are serious about us. I will be happy to be your husband.I was afraid to love again, but God showed me the way so I am going to is guiding me in the right direction this time.

Since you became part of me ...

The miracle of life shown in front of my eyes when you entered my life.. Nothing can be compared to this feeling of filling up somebody's life.The excitement which tortures me while waiting for you to send me an email, the sweet emails that keep me awake even when I'm exhaustedto death, because I wouldn't miss a thing. The feeling that you know every corner of my heart.. All these things are the most beautiful signs of my love for you.every single word you say is a part of my soul, as if I have already known what you have been about to say. Every step I make is safe, because you are around me. When we first met, I didn't even suspect what a wizard you were about to be. But apparently life can show us such wonders, that we can stay amazed like children, wondering how this could happen to us! Well, I want to thank you for being my best friend, for being my angel.I have never felt like this before. Nobody has taken me so far, except you, my princess from the clouds.You brighten my days and give me the strength to carry on, fighting everyday for you. You revealed the deepest emotions and feelings I'vekept inside of me for so long. Feelings I didn't even suspect to be. But most of all, you showed me the real taste of love. You are my best friend and the one I want for life, my yesterday, my today and my tomorrow. You are the one I want everybody to know it!  I haven't had astronger feeling like this one I have now though,I want to wake up with you....Here it goes like a "Song'... I Want To Wake Up With You Iwanna wake up with you I wanna be there when you open your eyes I want you to be The first thing that I see... I wanna lay by your side,Baby I wanna feel every beat of your heart And throughout the night I wanna hold you tight... All the love inside me has been sleepingWaiting till the right one came along You can share the love that I've been keeping, Baby You can put the music to my song I wanna wake up with you I wanna reach out and know that you're there I want you to be.The first thing that I see I wanna wake up with you And throughoutthe night I wanna hold you tight I wanna wake up with you All the love inside me has been sleeping Waiting till the right one came along Youcan share the love that I've been keeping You can put the music to my song I wanna wake up with you I wanna reach out and know that you're there I want you to be The first thing that I see I wanna wake up with you I wanna lay by your side, baby I wanna feel every beat of your heart And throughout the night I wanna hold you tight I wanna wake up with you All the love inside me has been sleeping Waiting till the right one came along You can share the love that I've been keeping, Baby You can put the music to my song I wanna wake up with you Iwanna reach out and know that you're there I want you to be The first thing that I see...

My Hope For us

I don't know how to approach this with you in person, every day I fight a battle with myself my heart says I should tell you how I feel, but myhead tells me not to be stupid that it would just cause damage to our friendship and that you wouldn't be interested.I know that there isprobably very little I can say to change your mind either way; I am not totally discounting the possibility that the way I feel about you could bereciprocated, but as I have very little luck in this area in the past my hopes are fairly small.I wanted to put into words my feelings in the hopesthat although you may never see the words in writing or even hear them from my lips that you would still know that I care deeply for you, I feel that given the chance this could turn into more, but I guess that will depend on you and how you feel about me.I can't pinpoint whatexactly it is that makes me feel that you do have some feelings towards me. Maybe it's due to the way that when I talk to you, how you nearlyalways look me in the eyes; so few people do that.I wish I could vocalize my feelings to you but my fear prohibits me so much I think that by the time I finally gain the courage, that you will be with someone else. My biggest fear is that I would tell you and I would see a look of fear or horror on your face that would break me.I wish I could tell you how every time you don't turn up online I fear that I will never see you again or that you will get into trouble with people; I just want to protect you so much.I see you sometimes and you look down even though you maypretend otherwise. I wish you would open up to me and let me in to your life. I know it wouldn't be easy but I still believe that I could be good for you, if only you could return my feelings. I know I may not be the best looking man, you know, all I could offer you is my heart and soul.I fear that this will not turn out the way I hope but I pray that it does. As I said before, you may never know the true extent of my feelingsalthough I would imagine you have some suspicions.This may be a crush or infatuation but I swear to you that it does not feel like it, as I have had crushes before but never really felt the kinds of emotions I do for you.I hope that if I can muster the courage to tell you how I feel, that whatever your feelings, it will turn out okay and that at the very least we can be good friends, but I long for so much more. My Hope Forus

I know you've said we could do foolish things while in love, but you know what? With you I wouldn't mind being a fool for the rest of my life. I love you so much and I know you love me too. I know that others looking into our relationship might think that we're saying too many foolish things too soon but they just don't know how we feel about each other. There's nothing foolish about the things I've told you, I meant every word I said. I love you and for you .. I would do anything, I love you so much.

Here are a few things I wish to do with you at some point in this lifetime:   Be your best friend. Get caught with you in the rain. Dance with you in the rain. Stargaze on a clear night. Watch the sunset together. Spend all day with you doing nothing. Moonlit walks on the beach. Bemore proud of you than I already am at this very moment. Go on a carriage ride through the park. Do a crossword together. Go to brunch. Have a disagreement (it could/will only make us stronger). Go for a twilight horseback ride. Watch a bad movie together. Spend the rest of my life with you. Have our picture taken together. Eat ice cream with you. Make love to you passionately. Go to a museum together. Talk to each other using only body language. Give you space when you need it. Accept you totally and completely - flaws and all (I already do). Discusscurrent events in a heated debate. Have you see the error of your ways from aforementioned heated debate and make mad, torrid love to you, in the midst of all that passion. Carve our names into a tree/table. Go for a walk at dusk together. Be one with you. Send you a singingtelegram. Spend all night thinking of 101 sweet things to do for you. Hold you and gaze into your eyes and realize how much I love you...and tell you. Gently run my hand across your cheek and look into your eyes. Blindfold you and take you somewhere romantic. Spend my life making you happy. Spend my life making our family happy. Feel your heartbeat. Go roller/ice skating together. Give you a backrub just because. ALWAYS being honest with each other. Go hiking/camping together. Have our first fight, make up and feel a stronger bond because we very successfully weathered the storm - together. Laugh at someone together.. Share a plate of spaghetti. Give you a stuffed animal just because. Go on a fun family vacation and bring back the kind of memories movies are made of. Treat you like my Lancelot. Go on a road tripacross America. Count thunder together during a thunderstorm. Envelop you in my soul. Know you better than you know yourself. Go to aRenaissance Fair. Plant a tree in our yard together. Look over at you during an office/military/family party and have you know without me saying a word - that I love you. Be able to say "I love you" in 89 different ways - in 89 different countries. Hold you when you're at yoursaddest and comfort you when you need it the most. Be the one you come to for that comfort and holding. Wipe away the days' stresses andissues, with just one hug/kiss. Grow old with you.    Love Always,

I am so thankfull to God .

I am so thankful I met you! You are the most important person in my life. I never thought I would find someone like you to share my life with, and now I don't even want to imagine what my life would be like without you in it. I love the way you make me laugh, how we tell each other everything. Wherever you are is where I want to be. There's no one else on earth. It feel like we're the only ones here. I fall madly in love with you more and more each day. If thereís one thing in this world I know, it's that I AM SO IN LOVE WITH YOU!!

My love for you .
 
It should be emphasized that the kind of love existing in our relationship is void of fantasy or a whirlwind romance. If you don't know, my love for you isn't the comparative analysis of "M&B"stories or any other fictional romance. But this is the love that is enveloped with the seal ofreality without any shadow of doubt..Not that there are no other fish in the ocean upon whom I can sling my hook, but who can be like YOUthat loves me with such generosity of heart? I love a hand that meets my own with a grasp that causes some sensation and which only your'scan do. I love you not only because of beauty but for your sense of decency,delicacy, kindness and other complementary qualities. I can't helpdoting on you. Therefore all my gestures of love towards you come straight from the bottom of my heart, I swear

The love i have for you is unconditionally ...

Dear Lover,  It doesn't take a genius to work out how much I love you, but it takes a very clever man to work out why. You are the gentlebreeze in my world of chaos, the calming presence that tells all to be still. When I am down you lift me up, when I am tired you spur me on. When I sleep I snuggle in the warmth of your embrace and feel safe. You are my security blanket, from the everyday rigors of life. I cherishthe day we met, and the love we share. Thank you for being my rock, my confidant, my friend, my gentle breeze ....  My love unconditionally,

I had a dream of our love together ...
 
My Love My Life,

        I had a dream about you... It started with me sitting on the couch. You walked over to me and as you stood there, I caressed your leg,running my hands up your thigh, then up under your denim shorts to feel your sexy ass. My caresses instantly got your passion stirring and you leaned over to kiss me. You crawled on the couch over me, straddling me and kissing me deeper.We started to get more into it the more we kissed. My hands were roaming your body now, then caressing your neck and face as I slowly kissed you. I felt you moan softly in mymouth as you lowered yourself a little more onto me, and start to grind against me,feeling how hard and excited I was. The next thing I knew, you were tugging at my shirt, pulling it up and over my head--then you ran your hands all over my chest as you continued to gyrate againstme. My hands grabbed your hips, pulling you down against me, and then I slid them under your shirt, slowly caressing your side and along your back. You arched your back a little as my hands moved back around the front, up under your breasts.. I gently massaged around them,lightly passing my fingers over your nipples, which were hard now and pressing out against the fabric of your bra. As I caressed you, youreached down and pulled your T-shirt up and off, tossing it aside. Then you gave me a sex-filled look as you undid your bra,sliding it down anddropping it to the floor. I took my time to view your gorgeous breasts, tracing my fingers along your areolas. Then I gently pinched and pulledat your nipples. I sat up, kind of on the edge of the seat cushion--we were still kissing, but now you were in my lap, with your legs wrappedaround me and arms around my neck. I had my hands on your back, caressing your silky skin.. I broke our kiss and start to kiss across yourcheek, over to your ear, nibbling on it. Then, I slowly kissed down your neck, nibbling and licking as I did. I continued down along yourshoulder, then back across along your throat, then back up to your other ear.. Apparently you were enjoying the sensation, because I heardyou softly moan as I kissed you.I kissed back down your neck, then down the front of your chest, down between your breasts, then circlingaround, working my way to one of your nipples. I kissed closer and closer, and then I flicked my tongue at your nipple, circling it, then suckingit into my mouth.You arched your back at this point, moaning a little louder, wanting more. I half stood up and then laid you down on your back on the couch. I knelt on the floor next to it and took one of your feet in my hands, as I massaged your foot, I leaned forward to kiss yourankle. Mmmmmm... I continued to rub your leg as I slowly kissed up your calf as you lay there on the couch.As I started to kiss and lick my way along your inner thigh, you spread your legs a little more, your hands moved up over your head. I kissed slowly up your thigh, kissing,nibbling, and making little circles with my tongue. As I got closer, I noticed you had slid your hands down your side, down to your shorts. Youmoaned softly and started to push down on the waistband a little.. Seeing you needed some help, I grabbed your shorts and helped you slidethem down, over your hips, running my fingers down your long, silky legs and then dropped them on the floor...

I Love You ,

Containers Payment

Hello My Honey,

   I write this message in the middle of both happiness and depression . I am also happy that I have you in my life. On the other hand, I amdepressed because an equipment got lost in transit. Immediately after I got the confirmation that the contract has been approved , I shippedsome equipments so that I can get them and use them here for the project. On getting to the airport today to pick the equipments, Idiscovered that the major one is missing. I tried to talk to the shipping company but they instisted that there is nothing they can do about it since I was the one that shipped them myself. I spoke to the man that was assigned for me as my assistant here and he told me we can find it in a company here. We went to the company and we found the equipment, but the problem is the cost compared to what I have. The pricefor the equipment is $13,000 and I only have $10,500 cash with me. I need to get $2,500, I tried to use my debit cards here but it couldn't work here in africa, I would have love to call my bank but my bank will never release any money from my account if I am not present inPerson. This is the problem that I have honey. I would have loved to explain to the company that gave me the contract but this can wreck mycareer as it not presentable.. I am confused and you are the only Person that I can explain these to. I know it is not right for me to tell you all these but it is my problem and you are the only one I can tell. Honey, I know it is wrong for me to ask you for a help but I don't have any otherPerson to tell. I need you to borrow me this fund so that I can get the equipment as soon as possible and start the work on time, honey, I really need you to help me out so that I can finish up and come to you on time. As soon as I get to you, I will pay you the fund. I will look up to read from you soon. I Love you so much Honey .

You are my last hope.

Hello Mom,
       
      This is Jane amosesslima. I am writing this letter to you with tears in my eyes, I would confess that i regret the first ever travel outsideUS with dad. I regret us coming to Nigeria. On our way out to see around the city , and where the work will be done. Some 'gang' cameacross us fully equipped with different kinds of armed materials like Knife , Sledge hammer and other things. They said to Us to bring allvaluable things on us out and Dad was arguing and dragging with them while he told me to stay back cos he wouldn't want me to be harmed, one of them pushed Dad on the floor and one placed a knife right to my neck and i was unable to even say a word, they took Dad's credit card

My Love,

I want to thank you for all the support that you've shown me; thank you for giving me the courage to fight for our love. After all the pain, sacrifices, hardships that we've been through, it's all worth it because of the outcome. Thank you for being so caring and sweet. Thank you for being so just so wonderful in every way.Thank you for letting me love you like I do. Thank you for always being sincere. I want to thank you for your trust, for understanding all my tantrums, and of course for loving me and accepting who I really am. Thank you for the patience, even though sometimes I'm stubborn and childish. You know I can't imagine my life without you. You've really left a mark in my life. You taught me how to fight for something that is truly worth while; you taught me how to trust myself and for all that, I love you so much!! Thinking of you and missing you always,

Thank You the Surgery Went Successfully!

Dear Love,
          I do really appreciate all your effort and i never mean you didn't care but i do understand how things come out, the surgery was done and i had to rest for a while that is why i haven't written to you so far. I have intended on not working here anymore after this bad incident as i do believe that people are bad here and i don't want to risk i and my son life anymore. I have intended on coming back home and will count my coming here as a waste of time but you do understand me that i don't want to risk our life as i really want to be with you and i would not want to miss the chance of being with you just because of anything. Since we got a one way trip ticket since we intend to come to you from here , I need you to loan me about $2800 for us to get ticket back home and come to you and when we get to you , we will all go home together and i will get you paid with everything you have loaned me. Please i just cant stay here anymore , i really need to get home and i know you would not want to miss our meeting in life too . I will be waiting to read from you so i can instruct you where to send the funds to. Kindly let us know the airport we will be flying to also so we can just book it as soon as we get the funds from you...
 
I Love you so MUCH!!

You are my sunshine 

Good Day My Sunshine,If tomorrow the sun were to rise in the eastern sky, as it always does, but this time to rise without my life within this world, I want you to know how much I love, admire, and respect you. You're a terrific woman, one who through everything going on, has stayed by my side as much as possibly allowed. One who has loved and supported me and given me strength and a shelter for my heart to come home to. A safe haven for my love to grow within. In the short time that I've lknown you, not a day has gone by that I wasn't already in love with you. At times you have wavered but your heart has always led you back to me. Your patience in this situation has been unbending, beyond what any other woman would have been able to handle. This time that we've been forced to stay apart has given me a clear insight to the kind of woman you are and I am honored that you have given me your heart, and that you have taken mine with such a gentle kind love. You've stood by me in all this. You've lent me your ear when I've needed to vent. You've given me your advice when I felt lost. You've offered my your unwavering support when I've been scared and you've given me your strength when I didn't think I could take another second in this. But you've also pushed me hard when I've needed it, even when I tried to resist it. When I've been too tired to go on you've been behind me pushing me forward. You've cried with me when I've been hurt and you've cried for me when I've been sick. Only a best friend would do this and you truly are the best friend I have ever had. I look forward to your being my best friend for the rest of my life. I love you so very much.I admire you for your strength, your kindness, your gentleness and your patience. Not just in this situation, and not just to me but in the way I've heard you speak of others. You have an uncanny ability to exude warmth and love in just a few words. To inspire myself and others to focus better, try harder, strive deeper. To heal, to be strong, to be happy in spite of myself, and to always keep going forward, even when the wall in front of me seems insurmountable.. You are my biggest champion and the greatest love I have ever known.You point out the good things about me when I am feeling at my lowest. When I can't find a real Daughter for anyone to love me, you show me that you do. When I can't find a real Daughter to smile, you make me laugh. And when I look in the mirror and see nothing but a dark ugliness showing in my reflection, you force me to look deeper and make me feel good about myself again. You don't give up on me but more importantly you continually refuse to let me give up on myself. When my days were darkest and death seemed to shadow my every breath you were the only ray of sun shine in my eyes. It was you and your love that kept leading me back from the bowels of Hell that threatened to swallow me. And it was you who kept me from being afraid. When I would fall to my knees in weakness, the knowledge and warmth of your love gave me the strength to stand up again. My biggest fear now is that I will never be fully worthy of your love, but I will forever keep trying to be the Person you see me as. And I will for ever and always continue to love you, deeper than the blue skies blanketing our summer days.You are my heart, my world, my soul, my spirit, my best friend and my every breath.I am honored now to be your one true love. I will be ever more honored to one day be your HUSBAND..And I will pass from this world happily smiling into your loving eyes and with a promise to wait for you for forever ... until it is your time to join me in eternity. I will truly love you for forever.

Love Always,

It seems like we've been together for so long that I think I've known you forever. I feel the nearness of you even though I know we are miles apart. I feel your touch knowing we haven't been around together.  I feel your breath knowing we haven't kissed. I have all these feelings because I am connected to you not physically but mentally and wholeheartedly. I have you in my heart since the day we got together. I could feel my heart beating fast everytime I see your
messages for me and your outpouring of love just enveloping with passions and emotions and I cannot help but shed a tear or two for all the wonderful things you say to me.

I sit and think that it is so hard to believe that just a few daysago we were two lonely dreamers on the dating site (which i hope you are not more on). knew I would forever be by your side -- forever your partner and forever your love. And, now forever your husband. I know I don't express it nearly as often as I should, but baby, don't doubt me. I love you more now than I ever thought possible. And that love grows each and every day. Every time you smile, and every time you have that look in your eyes. I am yours, you hold my heart.

You amaze me. You make me dance, when before I wanted to walk. You make me sing, when before I only whispered. You make me see, when before I was blind. You are the constant in my life.  I fell in love with you when I realized how blissful love is. It is rare, but, when your heart finds it there is nothing that deters you away. You have baptized me with your love. What a blessing. What a priceless gift. How did I get to be so lucky? Lucky to have found you. My love, always, forever ... I love you.  Love always,

   Here is to a woman I thought I'd never know. The one who stole my heart so innocently, but with care and grace and perfect love. The perfect thought is us together forever. The sweetest word is your name. And the greatest thing is your love. Every silent prayer that has left my mind, all the empty words that have left my mouth and chased my lips, and all the lonely tears that have escaped my eyes have made me who I am, one to love you more. All the times I felt I've found the one, and all the times I've mourned over a bleeding heart, all the times I've given it all I've got is are as many as I have found my face in the mud. . I love you so much, those five words I tell you so much can't have more meaning than anything else ever possibly could. I love you with all my faults and all my  achievements. I love you with all that I am. I love you for who you are. I hope in the quietest of the night when I whisper out to you you know just what to do. You listen to hear my voice echoing how much I love you.There are no words to express the gratitude I feel in my heart that our hearts have come to dwell together, as one. You are my life, my heart, my soul. You are my best friend. You are my one true love. The day we met was fate. Our lives intertwining was fate. You are my destiny. I love you more today than I did yesterday, and I'll love you more tomorrow than I do today. Love is the only thing that makes life worth living. Your love. With all my heart I am forever yours. I have never in my life met someone more beautiful, enjoyable, loving, and comforting as you. I had no idea then that I would fall in love again, but now that I have, I am so grateful. I am grateful for us to have wandered into one another's world so softly and unexpectedly. Nature took its course on our hearts and joined them in a way never imaginable.I want you to know, that from the very depths of my heart, I love you. And I love everything that creates you, from your hair - that I wish I could play in more often... to your forehead - that I wish I could kiss while you sleep; from your eyes - that sparkle when you smile (just for me)... to your nose - that I wish I could rub my nose against; from your lips - that I just know were made perfectly to fit against mine... to your chin - that I would love to place my finger under to pull you close for a kiss; down your neck and to your heart - that in my own, I claim as mine, and down past every inch of every part of your existence.I wish more than anything that you and I could grow together, love together, learn together, and laugh together, forever.I sincerely feel that between the two of us, we have the kind of love that some people never get a chance to experience. I promise to love you as much as I can, as best as I can, and for as long as I can. And no matter what, it's very important to me for you to know that you are an irreplaceable spirit that will always be a part of me.   Love always

   Each night before I sleep your sweet words through my mind. As I rest my head on my pillow a smile seeps through my soul, knowing that you, and you alone have made me whole.Without you I would simply be surviving, but with you I am living life to the fullest. Because of your love my spirit has been rejuvenated.The simplest pleasures in life bring me so much joy that it is hard to find the words to describe them. A walk in the park becomes a reality based metaphor... it is our journey together hand in hand forever more.Our banter that may seem odd to others makes us giggle to no end. The difference between you and I are very few, yet they are there. But we accept those differences, embracing them because they are part of something we love about one another.It isn't about looks, nor money but the simplicity in life that we find so attractive. Knowing we could survive anywhere as long as we were together.Love is not a job, love simply is. Unconditional love is what I offer you, and with you I receive the same. You are my heart of hearts, my soul mate, friend, lover and partner for life.I will love you forever and a day. Thank you for being there, loving me and knowing what my true heart wants. Love always,

Moses.

  Baby, I can never explain the feeling I have had over this last week, it seems months, maybe it is because every moment you have been gone has been filled with memories playing over and over in my mind, beautiful memories. The fear that clenches my stomach is beyond comprehension, to live another day with out you would not be living, you are my breath, my pulse, you make me whole. I am empty; fill me with passion for life

  I know right now we can't be together but I will be waiting for you when God reviews us. I pray every night and day that he sees the love I have for you. I feel like I can't breathe.You let me be me and make me feel so special.. I know God has something good in store for us. He is not an evil God but a loving God. And when we are in each other's arms , that love will be more amazing than what we have now. I can't wait to hold you soon, with God's Approval. In the Lord we will seek
together and live a great and Godly life. I miss you and love you with all my heart. Till we are in each others arms ... I will be waiting.

 I wonder what would have become of me if you were not right with me. Your love is the sunshine that  shines every day of my life; you are the rain that showers in my soul ... love is a magic; it works like a miracle. Your love is magic, I am so glad to be with you.I'm lying in my bed, thoughts in my head, visions of you, but I
cant get through the night. Each time I closed my eyes, I started thinking of you. I am very tired and trying hard to sleep but I just couldn't sleep. You are always on my mind and I'm going crazy because of you. You lying by my side would make the darkest night shine brightly. Your ignorance is making my heart ache and broken into pieces which can't be mended. I love you, my dearest sweetie pie.no matter what or how, I wish to be with you all my life and into the afterlife.   Love always,

       Loving you comes so easy to me. You are the wind beneath my wings, the cream in my coffee and the flowers in my garden of life.Sweetheart, we've laid our sorrows in each othersí hands and we've guarded them with tenderness. We've trusted our grieving of those we love to our hearts and we protected it with our gentleness, like delicate breezes touching the water. With unbending confidence even through the worst pain, we have given each other strength beyond compare, and we have hung together in the toughest of times.We will stand together in the best of times and continue to share a love, devotion and care that will span far more than our lifetime Holding each other through darkness of night and waking to the brightness of day - knowing that God is where we are - we will know peace again. Our love has survived it all and I thank God for you every day.  Love always,

      Most seem to see not what they want in life, but what is expected for them to have and achieve. As for me, the moment that I meet you, a war began. The war of Love,My objective with meeting you was to be friends and never progress. Except one thing went terribly wrong .... I knew that divine love had me under attack. I was lost, alone, and afraid and the thought of loving you scared me. I have seen through the battle and have come out on top. I love more than I could ever love any human being. You are my woman, my ray of sunlight after the rain, my piece of cake when sweets are craved, my everlasting joy, my undetainable pump that pulsates to keep me alive and have you near, you are my baby. I love you for you have shown me love's divine attack. This is one battle that I am glad to have lost, and sharing the prize of never-ending love.  Love always,

      Words become a burden, when it is you that I am trying to express my love to. You see, it is a very deep, heart-felt love! One that only the right words can do justice to. You lighten my day regardless of what the day really may be. If it is raining, the very thought of you turns the rain drops into drops of your love for me,
that saturates my very soul with the assurance that I will never have to be without your love again. Am I dreaming? Is it real? These are the questions that I asked myself when I awaken from the experience of your love for me. Then I realize that it is real. You do love me and I do love you! What joy! That is something that I never had before, and when it is threatened, my body goes through convulsions or something; I experience pains like I never thought possible. The fact is, I love
you with this heart-felt love that is beyond verbal expression. For you give me joy. So, while I know that it would be beneath what I really and truly feel in my heart for you, just let me express my heart-felt love for you by merely saying, I love you.  With undying love,

You make me so happy.
Your the constant smile on my face.
The fire in my heart.
The love of my life.
The tingle in my body.
The joy in my tears.
The laughter in my voice.
The Daughterg in my heart.
The breath of my life.

Your my everything and make my life complete.I want you to know that you make me whole. Sending you tender kisses and all my love.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
 You are my air
 The sun in my day
 The moon in my night
 The spring in my step
 You are my everything.

 You are the stars in the sky
 The birds in the trees
 The shimmer, the sparkle, the shine.

 Without the light you put into my life
 I would be nothing
 A single leaf on the ground in autumn,
 Lost, forgotten, alone.

 Before I knew you,
 I was nothing.
 Now I am everything,
 With you at my side,
 I am invincible!

 Feel the same my baby,
 You are loved so much,
 I love you now and forever
 You are my darling, my baby, my love
 You are my everything
 I love you so much
