I received your interest email in regard to the errands  Runner Ad on Craiglist  Are you still interested in taking the job?





I would like to tell you more about myself before we get started. I'm a serving military man and I'm also into real estate business, right now I'm currently in need of a reliable personal assistant who will be  attending to all my personal errands while I'm busy with military jury duties. Okay? 





Good. I'm currently in need of a personal assistant that will be receiving and distributing mails, sit for delivery,pick up document at post office to my business partners around your location and some times you will be attending meetings on my behalf with my clients, hope you can handle the position diligently?

I will like to ask you couple of questions. Do you have any past criminal record? 





In brief can you tell me more about your self and the qualities you got which will make me employ you for this position





Good with the above qualities you mentioned I believe you are capable of handling my personal errand and without delays I will like you to get started. Which days/time of the week do you have open  schedule





In regard to compensation. I'm willing to pay $170 per assignment you execute for me and you will be executing at least 3 assignment within a week. i.e you will be earning minimum of $500 in a week. I hope that's good enough?





I would have love to have a face to face discussion with you because its risky for me to employ a personal assistant who will handle my personal business on-line, but as much as I will appreciate a face to face interview my military job will not allow me at the moment. I will be out of camp within next month then we can meet in person



How old are you ?



Do  have a medical history you think i should know of ?



Do you have a valid driver license or state issued ID ?



I want you to provide me with 2 reference for security reason before you get started



Okay good I believe today marks the beginning of a sound working relationship between us. I want you to reply me with your email address so that I can send you all my personal details with my recent  pictures so that you can get more familiar with the person employing you. 



And also i will be expecting you to take your Ads off craigslist since you will be working for me As my Errand Runner, so i will be putting all my trust on you



Okay very good. Which bank do you have an account with because you will be receiving payment to execute my errand to bank to bank deposit.







Fsnb is not among my affiliate bank. Since you dont have an account with my affiliate bank its necessary you set up an account with one of my affiliate bank because my associate only make payment  transactions through our affiliate bank for security reasons





My affiliate bank is Usaa





Me: Hope you are familiar with the bank? 12:52 PM





Me: Do you have a military person as a friend or a family member.







 Good since you have military affiliate you will be able to set up an account with Navy Federal. Hope you will be able to set up the account before end of today?1:35 PM





Okay no problem. Y ou can set up account with the bank onlines as well. there website is www.navyfederal.org 2:57 PM





Me: Okay very good. Have you completed the set up now? 5:54 PM







Me: Okay no problem I can instruct my account officer to set up a checking account for you and He will also stand as your reference so that the bank will definitely approve.



 Alright, Once the account is setup you are to make a deposit of $30 for the activation and for the bank to mail you the debit card the next day. I will be glad to reimburse you back immediately the account is setup. Is that understood ?
