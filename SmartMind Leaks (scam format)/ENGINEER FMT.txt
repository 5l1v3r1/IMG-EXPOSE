Thanks for the mail, I am really happy that I found your message. I know you would have read more about me in the previous message. I know I will be hoping to meet you soon, I must confess that I love the way you express yourself in your messages and i will like to know if there is any thing i haven't tell you more about  me that you will like to know. I love everything you wrote in your messages.  I decided to work for long hours so that I will not be sitting and thinking or feeling bad about my present situation. I am sure I am very close to the end of the situation. I feel that special woman that I am looking for is really close to me now. I am not trying to shop for women as I hate head games, I am looking for a long term relationship. I am searching for that woman that would make me feel complete. The woman that would be there for me all the time both in the happy and the sad moments of life. I have only loved once and I want to love again since my late wife has passed some years ago I have never dated any women.I want a woman that I would be able to share both my good and bad experiences with. A woman that we would both love each other for the rest of our life. I can understand that you have been through a lot. For now, I would like to know what you like in a man, I mean what you expect from a man, how you expect him to behave and how you expect him to treat you.. looking forward to hear from you soon again......Donald anns                                                                  ..........................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Thanks for the mail,I'm the most excited soul on earth reading such a wonderful ,Very sweet and passionate letter from you..You indeed sound so wonderful and so compassionate..I don't ever believe i could meet someone sweet and great like you in my life...I felt for you right from the first day i saw your profile..You look so great and so passionate ,I never believe i could be this lucky to meet someone like you... You make me so happy in just a little time and i will be so glad if you can have the same feelings as i do.. I felt for you right from the start.  I understand we need time to talk to each other and get to know much more about each other.I have been thinking about you since yesterday that I read from you. I can see we are looking for the same things. I want a woman that is loving and caring. A woman that would love me for me and always be there for me both in the time of sorrow and in the time of happiness. A woman that would give me a shoulder to cry on when I am sad, and laugh with me when I am happy. I have all these in folds and I am ready to return them to that special woman. I am a God fearing man, A one woman's man to say. I don't play games and I feel we are both matures and we don't need to bit around the bush any more. I believe one thing in life that there is no one in life that is perfect, only that we need to make the best out of what ever we've got. It is quite obvious that we are looking for the same thing in a partner and here we are together. I feel it is the right time for me to quit my search and stay with you. I can imagine a better future ahead of us. I hope I am not getting too forward for you but I am saying my mind. I feel it is high time for me to love and be loved again. What do you feel about that? Waiting to read from you.    .

 Hello Sweetie           
I just see myself keep searching for your email and believe me i am getting so acquainted to you . The bad things in life open your eyes to the good things you weren't paying attention to before....Love is not about finding the right person, but creating a right relationship. It's not about how much love you have in the beginning but how much love you build till the end....If it is meant to be, our hearts will find each other when we meet. And if our hearts melt together so will our bodies and souls. Then every word and every touch will fuel our passion flame. I will be yours, you will be mine, and we will be one....What is more important to you the love you share, the memories you have or the lover?Ever since we started sending the recent messages we've sent to each other...I've been so much thinking about you and to be sincere i am thinking about you.Wow! So here I stand, among the digital masses. We're not so different after all. Here I stand,surrounded by people who've met on-line, People who've loved and lost, and people who are found, and somehow, in a desperate world, found each other. So what do I say that hasn't already been written, or been already said? Hmmm, pretty tough! Okay... try this: I no longer need to hope for love by going to clubs, (y'know I can't dance!) supermarkets, church socials,by passing notes in class as a kid, or instant messages as an adult. I don't have to search for love, in ads, on the internet, in chat rooms, text messages, camera phones, faxes, and e-mails. I don't have to wait for good and bad feedback, have to need a good laugh, wait to talk, be told to shut up, look for hope, pray for a miracle, wait for an angel, see hope for God's love here on earth, wish for a special friend, crave for love's passion, envy others romance or wonder if someone will ever love me. Thanks for coming into my life.

Hugs and Kisses
Jack

At this point i will love u to text me on my phone on (559) 549-7036 .Since i first viewed your profile, I felt a great impulsion on me and ever since then i have been thinking about you ,i believe you might be an end to my search or to say a realization of my dreams because you are just what i am looking for , when i keep reading from you i feel that something is coming to be true and i pray and hope it does. I have deleted my profile from the site because this is what i have been searching for the past years and i would not trade this for the whole world, so i want to see where this go and being a one man woman , i will give this a total chance and i am sure it will take me to a good destination .I hope you have done the same and delete your profile on the site to see where we go from here so we can concentrate on each other and see what we have for each other...When I was a little boy,I dreamed of that one person that I would share my dreams, happiness and energy with ... I could not see her face but she was there. I always felt like she was out there, I just needed to feel her. I visualized the bond we would have and the courage she would give me to endure life's obstacles. All these years I was with others, and feeling my way through life, learning lessons that later on would prepare me to become the person that I am now. I have felt alone and sad. Then one day my eyes opened and I became that little boy again ... realizing that she is here now. Here in my world is the woman that I had dreamed of and I'd hoped would not miss our meeting in life ... That woman is you.

Awaiting to read from you soonest

 There is so much I want to tell you, a lot has been running through my head lately. I'm having trouble putting my thoughts into words so you will have to bare with me through this.I keep thinking about the future, about life, and what I want out of it. I keep thinking about us and what this relationship means to me.* I keep thinking about these things and I realize they go hand in hand. This relationship is my future; it's what I want out of life. I want to grow old with you. I want to experience this crazy love forever and ever, and I really think I'm going to get to. I want us to walk through new houses picking the one that would be just right for us. I want to see you walk around our house in a big t-shirt and catch me staring at how gorgeous you are. I want you to pull the covers off me at night and then I have to get even closer, if it's possible, to you to keep warm. I want to see you laugh like crazy at me when I do stupid stuff. I want to rub lotion all over your body because you laid out in the sun too long. I want to hold you when you cry and smile with you when you smile. I want to fall asleep every night with you in my arms. I want you to fall asleep on my chest listening to the beat of my heart and know it beats for you I want you to be the first thing I see when I wake up and the last thing I see when I go to sleep. I want to see your bad morning hair; I think it will be so cute. I want to sit on the beach with you and watch the sun set, and I want all the people who pass us to envy the love that we obviously have for each other.I want to see you walk down that isle and I want to take your hand for the rest of my life. I want to spend all night, and maybe the next day, making love to you with an undying passion (sorry to be so blunt). I want to sit there talking to you for hours about nothing at all but in the same time everything or maybe we won't talk at all and just grin at each other realizing how lucky we are. I want you to get mad at me for doing something stupid, and I want you to bust out laughing when you try to yell at me.I want us to run outside in the rain and act like total kids getting completely soaked, and when we come back in stripping down to nothing as we stumble into the bedroom, or the kitchen counter, or the balcony, or the dining room table, or an office desk, or the shower, which ever one we feel like at the time.I want it to take your breath away every time I say, "I love you" because you know it's coming from the heart.I want us to sit down with a box of strawberries, a bottle of chocolate syrup, and a thing of mint chocolate ice cream; well, I'll let your imagination finish that one. I want to love you and be with you for at least forever if not a little longer. I couldn't really express in words what I'm feeling right now so I decided to share with you SOME of the images and thoughts that have been running through my head.I just want you to know that I had never found someone I wanted to spend the rest of my life with until I met you. I really am crazy about you, Everything about you.Give love a chance to swallow you up. Don't just think it will happen in a instant, it will surprise you before you know it, but it will be the most rewarding experience you will ever have.....You know when you're truly in love, when all you can do is just be speechless and stare at nothing 'cause you're just amazed that you just found this incredible person....I'll surrender my world to you if that is the only way I could become a part of yours......The beating of my heart is a drum, and it's lost, and it's looking for a rhythm like you....We attract love by the emotions we display; we retain love by the emotions we possess...... I don't need anyone to take advantage of my weaknesses or my strengths, I need someone who will appreciate me for everything that I am.....Never turn your head from love and later wonder why you have such a stiff neck.....Love is hard to find, but once you find it you won't regret it...... may not be your first, but to be your last would be perfect.....If I don't know what true love is, how will I ever find you.... but I think you're perfect, think of how amazing it will be to find the one who is you Don't let real love pass you by.....Love happens whether you want it.Love and friendship is what I feel with you, it is not just that we are lovers, we are also friends, and that is what makes our relationship much better. The greatest of lovers don't make the best of friends, remember that, and when there comes a time when you feel that things can't get any worse, think of me, for I can try my best to bring you all the happiness in the world. I want to grow to love you more and more everyday, and I do not know right now what I would do without you. Sometimes I would like to think my love for you is like a great dream, I don't want to wake up because I don't want to lose that love. I will be by your side whenever you need me and I hope I am and always be in your heart and in your dreams forever.If I haven't told you - I am so lucky to have you in my life. I adore and love you so much! You are a wonderful woman and words cannot convey how much you mean to me. Just thinking about these feelings makes me tingle all over - to this day I still have butterflies in my stomach . I feel like these feelings should be left for teenagers only - I don't know if you understand what I am saying: it feels great to actually love and be love in return. I never feel less or more when I am writing to you; you always make me feel needed.most of all you make me feel safe, emotionally and mentally. Thank you for being part of my life. I'm very happy with you and I could not ask for a better woman than you. Thank you for being an exceptional woman - You are one of a kind..
Love always ,
Jack

I would take away all your pain Bring you sunshine instead of rain I would take all your hurt away Your sky would never be gray. I would offer you the moon and stars But you see I can't, they are not ours All these things I would give to you But My Darling, these things I can't do.

It seems like we've been together for so long that I think I've known you forever. I feel the nearness of you even though I know we are miles apart. I feel your touch knowing we haven't been around together. I feel your breath knowing we haven't kissed. I have all these feelings because I am connected to you not physically but mentally and wholeheartedly. I have you in my heart since the day we got together. I could feel my heart beating fast every time I see your messages for me and your outpouring of love just enveloping with passions and emotions and I cannot help but shed a tear or two for all the wonderful things you say to me. I am looking forward to all those and we'll see to it that we do most, if not all, The things that you want us to do together.I want to hold your hands to entangle it with mine and tell you we'll be holding our hands tightly together for us to be stronger and face whatever there is to face in our future. I want to caress your face and look into your eyes to tell you that we will be honest and loyal to each other while others will envy us. I want to feel our hearts beating like one because our love is one until the last breath we take knowing our love will never end.I should be able to come and visit you this weekend but honey i should be on my way to a business meeting right now and that will only take me jiust an house. i will inform you once am back from a meeting, I have a business meeting i will be attending today i will keep you update once am back, I would like to feel your strong body knowing I will share it because you want me to and because our love knows no bound.

Love,

I just got back from the airport now and I'm writing this message in the middle of both unhappiness and depression..Though I am happy that I have you in my life. On the other hand, I am depressed because i had to ship an equipment before leaving the state and the equipment got lost in transit. Immediately after I got the confirmation that the contract has been approved, I shipped some equipments so that I can get them and use them here for the project,That has been the reason why i tell you sometimes that i was busy. On getting to the airport now to pick the equipments, I discovered that the major one is missing. I tried to talk to the shipping company but they insisted that there is nothing they can do about it since I was the one that shipped them myself which i had no insurance for the shipment. I spoke to the man that was assigned for me as my assistant here and he told me we can find it in a company here.. We went to the company and we found the equipment, but the problem is the cost compared to what I have. The price for the equipment is $45,000 and I only have $40,500 cash and i have deposited it to the company...............  Sweetheart Right now I need to get $4,500, I tried to use my debit cards here but it couldn't work because it got broken when i mistakenly sat on it, I would have love to call my bank but my bank will never release any money from my account if I am not present in person. This is the problem that I have honey. I would have loved to explain to the company that gave me the contract but this can wreck my career as it not presentable. I am confused and you are the only person that I can explain these to. I know it is not right for me to tell you all these but it is my problem and you are the only one I can tell. Honey, I know it is wrong for me to ask you for a help but I don't have any other person to tell. Honey I don't want you to feel bad about this I hope you could understand me. I need you to borrow me this fund so that I can get the equipment as soon as possible and start the work on time, honey, I really need you to help me out so that I can finish up and come to you on time. As soon as I arrive to you, I will pay you the fund. I will look up to read from you soon. I Love you so much Honey and You are my last hope.

Lots of Love,
Jack ....

My Love,

  Here is the details below where to transfer the fund to and if you cannot get up to that amount just send all u can to assist me honey. pls kindly send it as soon as possible honey. The information is for my personal assistant to pick up the fund for me.  If you could send it at any western union money transfer that will be more better. but if that is not easy for you  well send it at any wall-mart store through money gram.  Honey kindly send the transfer  information immediately yo get it done.
